# Gap Analysis Report

## 1. CMAKE Integration Gaps
- Current Implementation: Basic script-based system
- Charter Requirement: "cmake based hierarchical and idempotent facilities"
- Gaps:
  * No CMake integration in expert system
  * Missing hierarchical build structure
  * No idempotency guarantees in build process
  * Lack of CMake-based progress tracking

## 2. Sandbox Environment Gaps
- Current Implementation: Single environment execution
- Charter Requirement: "addition of sandboxes... safe depository for later integration"
- Gaps:
  * No sandbox isolation mechanism
  * Missing stub generation for context
  * No integration graph for sandbox results
  * Lack of context management for SOTA LLM limitations

## 3. Cache and Permission Gaps
- Current Implementation: Basic file-based storage
- Charter Requirement: "redline cache in ~/.local/redline... posix permissions"
- Gaps:
  * Not using ~/.local/redline for agent storage
  * Missing POSIX permission implementation
  * No role-based access control
  * Lack of group/user separation for agents

## 4. Agent Organization Gaps
- Current Implementation: Fixed agent structure
- Charter Requirement: "organization should be adapted by another agent"
- Gaps:
  * No meta-agent for organizational adaptation
  * Static agent relationships
  * Missing agent role evolution
  * No dynamic tool grouping mechanism

## 5. Status Tracking Gaps
- Current Implementation: Basic logging
- Charter Requirement: "statusline details that can be shown to observer and agent"
- Gaps:
  * No real-time status display
  * Missing observer interface
  * Limited status detail granularity
  * No agent-specific status tracking

## 6. Tool Documentation Gaps
- Current Implementation: Basic function documentation
- Charter Requirement: "scripts load available functions and document those in the llm prompt"
- Gaps:
  * No automatic function documentation
  * Missing context purpose annotations
  * Incomplete LLM prompt integration
  * No dynamic tool discovery

## Required Actions

1. CMake Integration:
   - Implement CMake-based build system
   - Add progress tracking via CMake
   - Ensure idempotent operations
   - Create hierarchical structure

2. Sandbox Implementation:
   - Create isolated sandbox environments
   - Implement stub generation
   - Develop integration graph system
   - Add context management

3. Cache System:
   - Move to ~/.local/redline
   - Implement POSIX permissions
   - Add role-based access
   - Create group/user separation

4. Agent Organization:
   - Develop meta-agent for organization
   - Add dynamic role adaptation
   - Implement flexible tool grouping
   - Create agent evolution system

5. Status System:
   - Create real-time status display
   - Implement observer interface
   - Add detailed status tracking
   - Create agent-specific monitoring

6. Tool Documentation:
   - Add automatic function documentation
   - Implement context annotations
   - Integrate with LLM prompts
   - Create tool discovery system

## Priority Matrix

High Priority (Immediate):
- CMake integration for build system
- Sandbox environment implementation
- Cache system with proper permissions

Medium Priority (Next Phase):
- Status tracking system
- Tool documentation automation
- Basic agent organization

Low Priority (Future):
- Advanced agent evolution
- Complex integration graphs
- Detailed observer interfaces

## Conclusion

The current implementation, while providing a foundation with the expert system, has significant gaps in meeting the charter's full requirements. The most critical gaps are in the CMake integration, sandbox implementation, and proper cache/permission handling. These areas need immediate attention to align with the charter's intent of creating a robust, hierarchical, and secure development environment.
