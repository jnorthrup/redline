# LLM Connector: User Feedback Loop Implementation

## Overview

This implementation follows the charter's guidelines for creating an iterative, adaptive user feedback loop for Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. The system is designed to provide a sophisticated mechanism for reasoning, planning, and continuous improvement.

## Key Components

### 1. Supervisor Agent (`supervisor.py`)

The `SupervisorAgent` implements the core reasoning and feedback loop mechanism, following the charter's six-stage process:

1. **Assigned Task (Input Trigger)**
   - Captures the initial task
   - Stores task as a reasoning message
   - Initiates cognitive reasoning

2. **Initial Reasoning and Thinking Model**
   - Generates explanations
   - Identifies knowledge gaps
   - Derives initial findings

3. **Planning Phase**
   - Breaks down the task into modular steps
   - Identifies required tools and resources

4. **Action Execution**
   - Prepares for tool utilization and external commands
   - Tracks action observations

5. **Iterative Feedback Loop**
   - Processes user and system feedback
   - Applies bias corrections
   - Recalculates technical debt
   - Refines reasoning approach

6. **Completion Status**
   - Signals task completion
   - Provides final metrics and reward calculation

### 2. Agent Memory (`agent_memory.py`)

The `DefaultAgentMemory` provides advanced memory management:

- Tracks reasoning steps
- Calculates technical debt
- Manages memory capacity
- Supports bias correction
- Provides comprehensive memory statistics

### 3. Interfaces (`interfaces.py`)

Defines protocols and data structures:

- `AgentMemory` protocol
- `Message` and `MessageRole` classes
- Utility functions for message creation

## Technical Debt Metric

The system implements a technical debt calculation as specified in the charter:

```python
technical_debt = (technical_debt_offset) / (tokens_needed ** 3)
```

This approach aims to curtail complexity and prevent excessive token consumption.

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize the supervisor agent
supervisor = SupervisorAgent()

# Process an initial task
task_analysis = supervisor.process_task("Reduce technical debt in the codebase")

# Process user feedback
feedback_result = supervisor.process_feedback("Focus on modularizing the core components")

# Complete the task
completion_status = supervisor.finish_execution()
```

## Key Design Principles

- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous adaptation based on feedback
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate concerns between supervisor, memory, and interfaces
- **Complexity Management**: Technical debt tracking and reward system
- **Extensibility**: Protocols and interfaces allow for easy extension

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced NLP for gap identification
- More sophisticated bias correction
- Advanced technical debt calculation
- Support for multiple agent interactions
