# CMake Best Practices for Project

## Directory Structure
- Each module should have its own `CMakeLists.txt` file in the root directory of that module.
- The top-level CMake configuration should be located at `CMAKELists.txt` in the root of your project.

## Dependency Management
- Use a consistent method for managing dependencies across all CMakeLists.txt files.
- Consider using `find_package` to manage external libraries and dependencies.

## Build Configuration
- Define build types (e.g., Debug, Release) in your top-level CMake configuration.
- Use conditional statements to handle platform-specific configurations.

## Testing
- Implement a comprehensive testing strategy using CMake's built-in commands or external tools.
- Ensure that tests are run as part of the build process.

## Documentation
- Document each CMakeLists.txt file with comments explaining its purpose and configuration options.
