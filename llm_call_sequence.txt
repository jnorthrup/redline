LLM Call Sequence for Task Handoff:

1. Initial Task Processing:
   - Prompt: "Process this task through the Charter system: integrate the code from run_cmake into the charter fulfillment agents"
   - Purpose: Initial task analysis and decomposition

2. Agent Handoff Loop:
   - While NEXT_AGENT is present in response:
     a. Extract next agent name
     b. Create agent-specific prompt
     c. Call execute_llm with agent prompt
     d. Process response

3. File Edits (if needed):
   - If FILE_EDIT is present in response:
     a. Call execute_llm for edit coordinates
     b. Process edit instructions

Note: The actual number of calls depends on the LLM's response and the complexity of the task.
