# C++23 Migration Plan

## Phases and Tasks

### Assessment and Preparation (2 weeks)
- [ ] Audit current codebase for C++ version usage
- [ ] Identify critical dependencies and compatibility
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with C++23 support
- [ ] Create coding standards for C++23 adoption

### Core Language Feature Migration (6 weeks)
- [ ] Implement modules where applicable
- [ ] Migrate to concepts for template constraints
- [ ] Adopt ranges and views for sequence operations
- [ ] Utilize coroutines for asynchronous operations
- [ ] Apply structured bindings and if-init

### Standard Library Modernization (8 weeks)
- [ ] Replace custom containers with std::span/std::mdspan
- [ ] Migrate to std::format for string formatting
- [ ] Adopt std::chrono for time operations
- [ ] Utilize std::expected for error handling
- [ ] Implement std::generator for coroutine-based ranges

### Error Handling Overhaul (4 weeks)
- [ ] Replace exception-based error handling with std::expected
- [ ] Implement std::stacktrace for error diagnostics
- [ ] Create consistent error reporting infrastructure
- [ ] Migrate logging to std::print

### Concurrency and Parallelism (6 weeks)
- [ ] Migrate to std::jthread for thread management
- [ ] Implement std::latch and std::barrier
- [ ] Utilize std::atomic_ref for atomic operations
- [ ] Adopt std::stop_token for cancellation
- [ ] Implement std::syncstream for thread-safe output

### Tooling and Build System Updates (4 weeks)
- [ ] Update CMake to support C++23 features
- [ ] Configure clang-tidy with C++23 rules
- [ ] Set up static analysis with C++23 support
- [ ] Implement module-aware build configurations

### Testing and Validation (6 weeks)
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit test suite
- [ ] Implement property-based testing
- [ ] Set up fuzz testing for critical components
- [ ] Perform performance benchmarking
- [ ] Conduct security audits

### Documentation and Training (4 weeks)
- [ ] Create internal C++23 style guide
- [ ] Develop migration documentation
- [ ] Conduct team training sessions
- [ ] Set up code review guidelines
- [ ] Create knowledge base articles
