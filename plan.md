# Project Plan: Simplagent Enhancement

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Boost.Asio Usage
- The project heavily relies on Boost.Asio for:
  - Asynchronous networking operations
  - SSL/TLS support
  - Coroutine-based asynchronous programming
- Replacing Boost.Asio would require significant refactoring and might not be practical because:
  1. C++23 networking TS is still experimental
  2. Boost.Asio provides a more mature and feature-rich networking API
  3. The codebase is deeply integrated with Boost.Asio's asynchronous model
  llvm, clang, etc. > 19.0 

 first is llm feedback conversation loop then hueristic memory for llm then agent roles and tools with redline mode
