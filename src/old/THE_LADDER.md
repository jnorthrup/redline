Below is a high-level architectural approach for incorporating a “ladder” of progressively larger LLM models into your codebase, along with suggestions for how queries, responses, and competence checks can be implemented. The idea is to start with a smaller, cheaper model and only escalate to larger, more capable models if the smaller ones fail to demonstrate sufficient competence on a given topic.

Key Concept: The Model Ladder
	•	Base Model (Smallest):
A lightweight model (fewer parameters, smaller context window) that’s fast and cheap to query. Useful for quick preliminary assessments, common-knowledge Q&A, or straightforward tasks.
	•	Mid-tier Model(s):
One or more intermediate-scale models that are more capable than the base model. These can handle moderately complex tasks or provide deeper analysis than the base model.
	•	Top-tier Model (Largest):
A cutting-edge, large-scale model (e.g., a multimodal or very large parameter count) that provides the richest reasoning, handles complex domain-specific queries, and can be considered authoritative.

Workflow Outline
	1.	Initial Query Handling with a Small Model
When a user query arrives:
	•	Send it first to the smallest model for an initial response.
	•	Along with the response, the small model generates:
	•	A self-assessment score of its confidence or competence on the topic (e.g., based on internal heuristics or a small prompt asking the model: “On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in this answer?”)
	•	Identified complexity factors: Are there domain-specific terms unknown to the model, or requests that exceed its known capabilities?
	2.	Evaluation Against Competence Thresholds
After receiving the small model’s answer and confidence score:
	•	If the confidence is high and the domain-specific checks pass (no unknown terms or complexities), return this answer directly.
	•	If confidence is low or the answer seems incomplete or ambiguous, escalate to the next rung on the ladder (the mid-tier model).
	3.	Querying the Mid-tier Model
When escalating:
	•	Forward the original question, plus the small model’s answer and reasoning summary, to the mid-tier model.
	•	The mid-tier model uses this information to produce a refined answer and a new competence assessment.
	•	If the mid-tier model’s confidence and quality metrics are acceptable, return the improved answer. Otherwise, escalate further.
	4.	Top-tier Model Invocation
If both the small and mid-tier models fail to produce a sufficiently confident and contextually rich answer:
	•	Provide the top-tier model with the full conversation context, including:
	•	The original question
	•	The smaller models’ attempts and their justifications
	•	Any domain-specific metadata or logs available
	•	The top-tier model then gives a final, authoritative response, presumably with a higher compute cost and token usage.

Implementing Competence Checking
	•	Model Self-Assessment Prompts:
After each model’s response, add a hidden (assistant-only) prompt like:

System: On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you in the correctness and completeness of your answer? Provide just the number.

Parse the model’s integer response as a confidence score.

	•	Complexity and Domain Checks:
The small model can attempt to identify “red flags”:
	•	Unknown domain terms
	•	References to advanced frameworks or technologies
	•	Multiple-step reasoning tasks where it got stuck
Add a step where the model tries to explain its reasoning process. If it produces unclear or insufficient reasoning steps, consider that a sign to escalate.
	•	Heuristics for Escalation:
Define thresholds:
	•	If confidence < 7 (for example), escalate.
	•	If the model’s explanation is shorter than a few sentences for a complex domain or is repetitive and vague, escalate.
	•	If certain keywords appear (e.g., “I am not sure,” “uncertain,” “requires deeper analysis,”), escalate.

Caching and Reuse
	•	To avoid repeating escalations for similar queries:
	•	Cache the results and competence assessments.
	•	If a similar query appears, start from the highest previously successful rung.

Performing Additional Web Searches
	•	At any rung, if the model identifies knowledge gaps, it can:
	1.	Perform a quick web search query to gather external context.
	2.	Incorporate that external data into its response.
	•	The top-tier model can also re-verify findings from web searches for final confirmation.

Example Implementation Steps
	1.	Configuration File or Class:
Define a configuration that lists the available models in ascending order of size and capability, along with prompts to measure confidence.

MODEL_LADDER = [
    {"name": "small-model", "max_tokens": 2048, "confidence_prompt": "…"},
    {"name": "mid-tier-model", "max_tokens": 4096, "confidence_prompt": "…"},
    {"name": "large-model", "max_tokens": 16384, "confidence_prompt": "…"}
]


	2.	Query Handler Function:

def handle_query(query: str) -> str:
    # Start with the smallest model
    response, confidence = query_model("small-model", query)
    if confidence < 7:
        # Escalate to mid-tier
        response, confidence = query_model("mid-tier-model", query, prev_response=response)
        if confidence < 7:
            # Escalate to top-tier
            response, confidence = query_model("large-model", query, prev_response=response)
    return response

Here, query_model() is a helper that:
	•	Sends query (and optionally previous attempts) to the model.
	•	Extracts the model’s main answer and then its confidence rating.

	3.	Confidence Extraction:
After the model’s main answer, append the confidence prompt and parse the numeric value. For example:

def extract_confidence(full_model_output: str) -> int:
    # Parse out the last integer line or a known marker
    # Could be a regex search: look for a line like "Confidence: X"
    match = re.search(r"Confidence:\s*(\d+)", full_model_output)
    return int(match.group(1)) if match else 5  # default to 5 if not found


	4.	Web Search Integration:
If the small model’s reasoning suggests a lack of domain knowledge:

if need_web_info:
    web_data = perform_web_search(query)
    # Re-query the model with `query + web_data` to improve the response



By structuring the system this way, your codebase gains a flexible, layered approach. Lower-complexity or well-understood tasks stay cheap and fast, while difficult or uncertain queries automatically escalate to more capable models, ensuring that the final user gets the best possible answer at a reasonable cost.
