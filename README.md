# Agentic Framework

The Agentic Framework is a modular system designed to manage and optimize the interactions of various agents in a collaborative environment. This framework implements a structured approach to agent-based task management, focusing on memory management, feedback loops, and reward systems.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

- **src/**
  - **agents/**: Contains the definitions of various agent classes.
    - `base_agent.py`: Base class for all agents.
    - `reasoning_agent.py`: Implements reasoning capabilities for agents.
    - `planning_agent.py`: Handles planning tasks for agents.
    - `action_agent.py`: Executes actions based on plans.
    - `feedback_loop_agent.py`: Manages the feedback loop process.
    - `completion_agent.py`: Verifies task completion.
  - **memory/**: Manages the memory system for agents.
    - `memory_manager.py`: Handles memory updates and retrieval.
  - **handoff/**: Facilitates data transfer between agents.
    - `handoff_manager.py`: Manages the handoff process.
  - **reward/**: Implements the reward system for agents.
    - `reward_system.py`: Calculates rewards based on performance metrics.
  - `main.py`: Entry point for the application.
  - `utils.py`: Contains utility functions.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd agentic-framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the framework, execute the main application:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This will initialize the agents, memory, and other components, allowing them to interact and perform tasks based on the defined logic.
