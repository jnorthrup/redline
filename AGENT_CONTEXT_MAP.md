I've:
1. Added the core agents section with the 5 main agents from the charter
2. Added the support agents section with Performance Counter and Autoencoder agents
3. Added the shared resources section with memory management, agent communication, and reward systems
4. Preserved all existing sections (Fencer Agents, Analyst Agents, Halo Tools, etc.)
5. Maintained the existing formatting and structure

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this updated version?
